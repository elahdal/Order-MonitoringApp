# Order-MonitoringApp
Order&MonitoringApp's a software application designed to manage and monitor orders placed by an employee at a counter. The project consists of two separate applications:

Order Entry Application: This application is used by the employee to record orders as they are taken at the counter.

Order Monitoring Application: This application allows a supervisor to track and monitor orders in real-time as they are being processed.

Key Features:
Real-Time Monitoring: The supervisor can view live updates of orders as they are entered by the employee.

Independent Launching: Both applications can be launched independently from their respective main files, and the order in which they are launched does not matter.

Code Design Principles: The code has been designed with a focus on reusability and single responsibility principles, ensuring that each part of the code has a specific purpose and can be easily maintained or extended.

This structure enhances the efficiency of order management and ensures a streamlined process for both the employee and the supervisor.
